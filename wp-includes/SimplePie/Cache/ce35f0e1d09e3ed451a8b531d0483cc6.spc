<p>Many customers expect the option to try before they buy when considering a purchase—after all, most of us wouldn’t drive off the lot in a new car without taking it for a test drive first.</p>



<p>The same can be true for students considering enrolling in your online courses. Even though <em>you </em>know your content is top-notch, a new customer might not be convinced before seeing it for themself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By offering some of your course content for free, you can give prospective students a taste of the class before they move forward with a purchase. If giving away the goods seems counterintuitive, rest assured: Offering a freebie doesn’t mean you’re leaving money on the table. In fact, it could lead to <em>more </em>revenue by attracting a greater number of students to try out your courses and ultimately make a purchase.</p>



<p>Ready to use free course content to strengthen your business and increase sales? Here are a few ways to get started.</p>



<h2 id="h-offer-a-sample-lesson"><strong>Offer a sample lesson</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s say you sell online Italian courses. Maybe a prospective student isn’t sure they’ll be self-motivated or engaged enough to stick to the lessons. By offering a sample lesson of your beginner’s course, students can make sure the class structure and approach is a good fit for the way they learn—then they’ll be ready to buy the full course.</p>



<p>With a tool like LearnDash, you can easily create free <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/sample-lessons/">sample lessons</a>. Simply toggle a switch in your lesson&nbsp; settings to open up the lesson of your choice to anyone who’s interested.</p>



<h2><strong>Unlock a paid course</strong></h2>



<p>If a sample lesson is the amuse-bouche that gives students a taste of your content, unlocking a paid course is like handing out a free lunch.</p>



<p>This generous freebie allows prospective customers to go deeper into your content than what they’d experience in a sample lesson. Maybe they even take a few <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/quizzes/">quizzes</a> and watch some video content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a robust course catalog, opening up a whole course for free can be an effective way to familiarize students with your content before they buy additional courses. This approach also works well if your courses are structured in a progression: For example, you might unlock the first course in a series, then students can purchase subsequent courses to take their knowledge to the next level.</p>



<p><strong><em>Tip: </em></strong><em>Already have a YouTube playlist that you’re ready to repackage as a free course? Use the </em><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/courses/course-create-wizard/"><em>Course Create Wizard</em></a><em> in LearnDash to create an entire course from a playlist URL.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Think beyond sales</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ungated-content-free">Gated content</a> isn’t just a marketing tool for white papers and ebooks. Whether you offer a sample lesson or an entire course for free, you can require students to register for free content. This allows you to collect their email addresses and build a high-quality <a href="https://www.learndash.com/email-marketing-best-practices-for-online-educators/">email marketing</a> list.</p>



<p>Ultimately, free course content can also generate powerful word-of-mouth marketing. You never know who might try a sample lesson and recommend your course to someone who becomes your next customer.</p>

<p><strong>Your course customers want your course but they don’t want to jump through hoops to buy it. Creating a seamless checkout experience will not only wow your customers but improve your conversion rates to increase your profits.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>At this point, you’ve probably already launched your course and you’re seeing a good amount of traffic. But that traffic isn’t translating into bigger numbers in your bank account due to an increased cart abandonment rate.</p>



<p>Currently, the <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">cart abandonment rate</a> for ecommerce sites is sitting at nearly 70% across the board with the culprit hiding within the checkout process. That sounds discouraging but there’s hope for your online courses and it starts with optimizing your sales funnel.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What’s a sales funnel?</strong></p>



<p>A sales funnel is just marketing jargon for your sales process. On the surface every ecommerce business model has a sales funnel that starts with capturing a prospective customer’s attention and nurturing them until they make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to selling your LearnDash courses, your sales funnel will need a few tweaks to create a smoother sales process for your customer that will encourage them to complete the checkout process. More checkout completions equals more conversions and that means more profits for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How to increase conversion rates on your LearnDash course checkout page with WooFunnels&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>LearnDash’s checkout process makes it super simple for your customers to checkout but sometimes you need a few extras to boost sales. This is where a sales funnel integration comes in handy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Out of the box, WooFunnels comes equipped with six pre-built pages: optin, optin confirmation,sales page,checkouts, one click upsell, and thank you pages. This makes designing your sales funnel easy so you can focus on more important things.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most important WooFunnel features.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>High-Converting Checkout Pages</strong></p>



<p>Checkout pages are fully customizable giving you the freedom to design the page however you want. It also gives you the option to create single or multi-step checkout pages.</p>



<p>The checkout experience for mobile and desktop are optimized to boost average order value (AOV). Use their order bumps feature to show unlimited&nbsp; bumps on the checkout. They can include cross-sells for faster shipping, other courses, memberships, and even subscriptions.</p>



<p><strong>One-Click Upsells</strong></p>



<p>If your course sales funnel isn’t seeing a ton of traffic, you can make the most of the traffic that you do get with upsells. You won’t even need to spend extra money on ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can set target based rules to show customers products they’re most likely to buy. This is based on the acceptance or rejection of the previous offer. Beyond the checkout page, you can even offer one click upsells to increase AOV.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Analytics &amp; Reporting</strong></p>



<p>Your funnel will continually need improving so having access to robust analytics and reporting is a huge bonus. Woofunnels reporting dashboard shows how your funnels are performing with real-time analytics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can see the view count and conversion rate of each funnel, track the revenue generated, compare the performance of funnels, and view detailed data for every contact.</p>



<p><strong>Diverse Page Builder Integrations</strong></p>



<p>WooFunnel integrates with Elementor, Divi, Oxygen, and Gutenberg. It has built-in modules and comes ready to import templates. Make use of the shortcodes to build with Thrive, Beaver Builder,or any builder of your choice.</p>



<p><strong>Built-In A/B Testing&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A/B testing software for funnels are pricey but you’ll need to determine which parts of your funnel are working. WooFunnels A/B testing can be set up in less than five minutes. You can run split tests and analyze headlines, copy, colors, buttons, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://buildwoofunnels.com">WooFunnels</a> is the most flexible sales funnel plugin that allows you to create detailed funnels for your courses. Depending on which pricing tier you choose CRM and automations are available as well. Overall, it’s probably a better option for you if you need more for less.</p>

<p><strong>As a learning management system (LMS), our #1 priority is helping you easily create, manage, and sell high-quality courses. </strong></p>



<p>According to Hubspot, LearnDash is the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-lms-plugin">best LMS plugin for WordPress</a> so it’s no secret that we’re pretty good at what we do. But we’re always looking for better ways to deliver the best elearning tools to support our learners. This is why we recommend integrating WooCommerce with your LearnDash membership to extend your course capabilities. </p>



<p>In this article, I’ll detail why the Woocommerce integration is the perfect choice to sell your courses. As a bonus, you’ll get a step-by-step walkthrough of how to install, set up, and use it for your site. </p>



<h2><strong>What Is Woocommerce?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> is a fully customizable, WordPress plugin that allows you to convert your WordPress website into a fully functional eCommerce platform. The plugin allows you to sell anything online and that includes your LearnDash courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-1024x576.png" alt="How To Sell Your Online Courses With WooCommerce" class="wp-image-29668" srcset="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-300x169.png 300w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-768x432.png 768w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-1422x800.png 1422w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-500x281.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One of the biggest wins with WooCommerce is having the capability to build your store without restrictions on design or payment processors which makes it an ideal choice for course creators.</p>



<h2><strong>Reasons To Use Woocommerce With Learn Dash</strong></h2>



<p>LearnDash is built to keep things simple for course creators but sometimes you may need more features to make your course site more robust when it comes to automation and user experience. The WooCommer plugin works as a collaborative plugin to increase the range of your LearnDash site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of WooCommerce’s most powerful features.</p>



<p><strong>Automation made simple</strong></p>



<p>For example the course <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/login-registration/learndash/">registration page for LearnDash</a> is simple enough to allow your learners to register for your course quickly. WooCommerce takes that to the next level with automatic course enrollment immediately after registering. This takes a few steps out of the registration process to improve user experience. </p>



<p>Additionally, WooCommerce allows you to process automatic refunds if you should need them and automatic course removals when your learners cancel subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WooCommerce is a beast when it comes to automation and user experience and it’s the perfect addition to your LearnDash membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Extensive payment gateway options</strong></p>



<p>Out of the box, LearnDash comes equipped with a built-in payment gateway system that accepts payments from processors like Stripe or Paypal. Since WooCommerce is more focused on the “ecommerce” part it adds a ton of features to beef up the payments system on LearnDash.</p>



<p>With WooCommerce you get access to over <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=1023&amp;collections=product&amp;page=2">100+ payment gateways</a> like Apple Pay, Square, and AfterPay. This gives your prospective learners the power of choice by offering a variety of payment options.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Supports physical and digital products&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Since LearnDash was created for courses, it has the best option for you to sell your digital courses with ease. When you combine it with WooCommerce, it allows you to sell physical products as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By having dual product capabilities you can better support your course community by offering more products like physical books, merchandise, and even other digital products like webinars</p>



<p><strong>More creative control over the checkout process</strong></p>



<p>When you integrate WooCommerce with LearnDash, you gain more control over what your customer’s checkout experience will look and feel like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can choose to have a traditional checkout process where your courses and product are laid out in a grid-based format. This is best for selling multiple courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re more interested in increasing course sales, you can use a LearnDash add-on like <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/samcart/">SamCart </a>to get a sales funnel flow. By going this route, you’re able to streamline sales through a one-page checkout experience and include upsells and order bumps to help increase sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By adding WooCommerce, you can customize your product pages to make them more user and sales friendly. You can design your checkout pages to feel more like a sales page with testimonials and product guarantees or give your learners more control to edit their shopping carts with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Subscription and membership capabilities</strong></p>



<p>LearnDash comes with <a href="https://www.learndash.com/features/">subscription and membership </a>capabilities and they work to allow you to customize recurring payment schedules that include course bundles and multi-course access based memberships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WooCommerce expands on those capabilities with added features such as <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/?quid=0769b7cb5f6a9989f0202b3d44fa81a8">auto-renew subscriptions</a>, upgrades/downgrades, and free trial offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Customizable tax and coupon options</strong></p>



<p>Although WooCommerces isn’t a substitute for a tax professional, it has a tax automation feature that will lighten your accounting load.&nbsp; When you set up your WooCommerce account you can choose to have your taxes automatically calculated upon checkout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Custom coupons are also available. WooCommerce allows you to do things like create custom coupon codes to encourage new sign up and referral codes to reward your current learners for inviting new members.</p>



<h2><strong>Top 5 WooCommerce Add-ons and Extensions To Use With LearnDash&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>For additional features and functionality, WooCommerce has hundreds of extensions and over 1,000 plugins to fit whatever you need. Take your course site to the next level with our top 5 WooCommerce add-on and extension recommendations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This add-on improves cart abandonment rates by eliminating the need for payment on a third-party website.</p>



<p><strong>Follow-Ups</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/follow-up-emails/?quid=c5cf3da1a6af2bc987ffa62e17e80ed3">Follow-Ups</a> add-on keeps learners engaged with less work and manual effort by allowing you to automate personalized, drip email campaigns. It can be used to check in with learners who are falling behind or missing course content and offer new courses to those who are interested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One notable feature is the integrated Twitter follow-up that automatically tweets learners when they buy or finish a course.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WooCommerce Instagram&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Do you promote your courses on Instagram?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-instagram/?quid=a453dbb0afa7c539d10f1b5553e0c7d8">WooCommerce Instagram</a> extension can boost course sales by allowing prospective learners to be redirected to your course page in one single click. It also helps you increase your visibility by defining product hashtags and allowing your audience to tag their images with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Affiliate for WooCommerce</strong></p>



<p>Courses are all about community. You can offer your community of loyal learners by making them course affiliates through your own affiliate program.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/affiliate-for-woocommerce/?quid=cec8fe4452e1856b55a067400905c268">Affiliate for WooCommerce</a> allows you to track referrals, sales, and commissions in addition to managing payouts. </p>

<h2 id="h-have-you-built-your-sales-page-yet">Have You Built Your Sales Page Yet?</h2>



<p>If you are focused on selling your online course one of the final things you have to do before launch is creating your sales page. Late last year I discovered a sales page that I liked and never had the time to circle back and break it down.</p>



<p>So today I&#8217;m going to show you&nbsp;<a href="https://minimumviablevideo.carrd.co/">Minimum Viable Video</a>&nbsp;and their sales page.</p>



<p>Now, before I get started, I should let you know, there are twenty parts to this page. That&#8217;s a lot of parts. You can likely get away with a bit less, but it was done so well, I felt like you need to see the whole thing executed so brilliantly.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s jump in…</p>



<h2>Part One: Let&#8217;s Start with the Hero</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/1.salespage-hero-1024x503.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59512"/></figure>



<p>There are two things I really like about this hero area.</p>



<p><strong>The first is that line above the headline, because it tells us who it is for</strong>. The worst thing you can do is let readers spend minutes going over your offering before figuring out it&#8217;s not for them.</p>



<p><strong>The second is that they&#8217;re connecting what&#8217;s being taught with how you can put it to work</strong>. In other words, even from the very start, Cam is telling us why we should take this course.</p>



<h2>Part Two: The Introduction</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/2.salespage-intro-1024x587.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59513"/></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re selling your online course with a sales page, one of the hardest parts you&#8217;ll likely have is the “talking about yourself” part. But this intro is done really well because it&#8217;s not the “about me” kind of section. Instead, this intro connects you to a real person, highlights that they know what they&#8217;re doing, and connects you (again) to the benefits / results that this course offers.</p>



<h2>Part Three: Don&#8217;t Be Afraid of Words</h2>



<p>One of my buddies,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JustinWise">Justin</a>, once shared an insight from all this work with Facebook Ads. He said that long ads were better (financially) than short ones. Not that short ones didn&#8217;t send more traffic. But that longer ones qualified the traffic better because the people who read the longer ones converted better (when it came time to make a purchase).</p>



<p>In this example, look at all the words that Cam is using to agitate the challenge. He&#8217;s not pushing deep into pain. But he&#8217;s stirring it up.</p>



<p>And he&#8217;s not afraid to use words, lots of them, to do it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/3.salespage-agitate-438x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59514"/></figure>



<h2>Part Four: Benefits as Imagine Statements</h2>



<p>What I love about this next section is that they are all benefits but done as imagine statements. What could you do and accomplish, if you were comfortable doing XX? Let me list all the ways.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/4.salespage-imagine-858x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59515"/></figure>



<h2>Part Five: Dealing with the Challenges</h2>



<p>Now, in this next section, Cam isn&#8217;t dealing with the buying challenges. He&#8217;s not working past your initial conflict over whether to sign up. Instead, he&#8217;s directly attacking the challenges you have with the problem his course is solving.</p>



<p>In other words, he&#8217;s demonstrating his expertise by dealing with your stress in a relatable way that makes you want to sign up and get more of this from him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/5.Salespage-challenges-798x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59516"/></figure>



<h2>Part Six: What&#8217;s Included in the Course</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re selling your online course you&#8217;re eventually going to get to the point where you have to tell people what they&#8217;re going to get. I really like how Cam sets this up. Again, there&#8217;s a lot of insight into how he&#8217;s shaping his content – focusing on benefits even as he&#8217;s telling you what you&#8217;ll get.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/6.salespage-included-1024x965.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59517"/></figure>



<h2>Part Seven: Testimonials</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve told you&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/video-testimonials/">how important testimonials</a>&nbsp;are. Well, you&#8217;ll see them here doing a superb job of convincing you to sign up for the course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/7.salespage-testimonials-1024x271.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59518"/></figure>



<h2>Part Eight: The Instructor</h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;re halfway into this page, it&#8217;s time to introduce you to the author and instructor of the course. But not just his name, but rather his history and qualifications to teach you what he&#8217;s going to teach.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/8.salespage-instructor-1024x695.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59519"/></figure>



<h2>Part Nine: The Course</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/9.salespage-course-1024x711.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59520"/></figure>



<p>Notice that this is the first time you get the course name. And even then, you&#8217;re getting a description of the course without getting the low-level details of the course. Normally we jump too quickly into the details before we&#8217;ve really made sure our reader / prospect is interested. And when they&#8217;re not, they skim past it.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve heard the “leave them wanting more,” well that&#8217;s how this is done.</p>



<h2>Part Ten: More Testimonials</h2>



<p>I don&#8217;t think you need another screenshot of this section. There will be more sections of testimonials. But I do like that the earlier section was text and three columns, and this one is text and two columns.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re likely thinking I would improve this to get video testimonials, but just you wait, he&#8217;ll get there.</p>



<h2>Part Eleven: Course Details</h2>



<p>Now we get to the actual course details. Notice that it starts with what the course isn&#8217;t and then moves into what it is. The focus is on effort, yours as a student, and not just a list of videos.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/11.salespage-coursedetails-782x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59522"/></figure>



<h2>Part Twelve: Video Testimonial</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/12.salespage-videotestimonial-1024x633.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59523"/></figure>



<p>Now we see the introduction (but not the final use) of video testimonials. I think they&#8217;re the best way to close the deal – because they&#8217;re high fidelity.</p>



<p>What you&#8217;ll notice if you watch the videos is that they&#8217;ve been tweaked to add call outs so that the viewer knows what to pay attention to.</p>



<h2>Part Thirteen: What You&#8217;ll Learn</h2>



<p>My favorite line on this whole page is the data-driven articulation of what you&#8217;ll learn in this course. Here is it, “<strong>Students in our previous cohort published over 100 videos combined and improved their skills by 68%.</strong>“</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a powerful way to articulate what you&#8217;ll learn in this course. Because it&#8217;s a data point, it&#8217;s factual, and it&#8217;s a result (not just part of the process).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/13.salespage-whatyoulllearn-911x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59524"/></figure>



<h2>Part Fourteen: Corporate Testimonials</h2>



<p>What I like about section fourteen is that it&#8217;s not just more testimonials. These are different. They&#8217;re corporate testimonials. And that&#8217;s powerful because you get to use those logos from companies you know and trust. It&#8217;s more powerful than just saying that you&#8217;ve helped individuals, small businesses and corporations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/14.salespage-corptestimonials-894x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59525"/></figure>



<h2>Part Fifteen: The Schedule</h2>



<p>It took us getting to part fifteen to see the actual contents of the course. I told you in part nine that they were leaving us wanting more. Well now we&#8217;re here and we get to see the details of the course via their schedule.</p>



<p>Everyone selling their course online will do well to see how slowly they got here.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/15.salespage-schedule-785x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59526"/></figure>



<h2>Part Sixteen: The Results</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/16.salespage-results-1024x906.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59527"/></figure>



<p>By now you realize that this course is a practical one with assignments. It&#8217;s a&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/theres-a-shift-in-elearning/">cohort-based learning course</a>&nbsp;that when completed will leave you with several artifacts that you can use after graduation. So showing you what you leave with is a powerful way to get you to sign up.</p>



<h2>Part Seventeen: Guarantee</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/17.salespage-guarantee-1024x401.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59529"/></figure>



<p>This is the kind of “money back guarantee” that I recommend to anyone I&#8217;m talking to about selling a course. It&#8217;s the “you have to show me you attended and put in the work, and if you&#8217;re still unsatisfied…” kind of approach.</p>



<p>I absolutely love it!</p>



<h2>Part Eighteen: More Video Testimonials</h2>



<p>Yes, even more testimonials. But you knew that was coming right?</p>



<h2>Part Nineteen: How To Know You&#8217;re Ready</h2>



<p>A section I don&#8217;t see enough on sales pages is this “how to know if you&#8217;re ready” kind of page. It&#8217;s an easy way to let prospects qualify and disqualify themselves without a lot of effort.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/19.salespage-ready-971x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59530"/></figure>



<h2>Part Twenty: FAQs</h2>



<p>The final section before another “enroll” now section, which is available in several places on the page, is the FAQ section. The biggest benefit to how these FAQs are designed is that they&#8217;re shaped to mitigate the most common reasons people stop themselves from buying the course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/20.salespage-faq-1024x1005.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59531"/></figure>



<h2>Selling Your Online Course? Always Look For Examples</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re getting ready to sell your online course, my recommendation is always the same – look for examples you like. Take screenshots, save them, and bookmark pages – all so you can come back and dig into them. Take what you like and use it as a model. Skip what doesn&#8217;t work for you.</p>



<p>But learn from everyone because doing this alone and from scratch is hard.</p>

<h2>Which approach is better when you&#8217;re selling courses?</h2>



<p>We&#8217;re in part seven of my series on online courses and it&#8217;s time to talk about how you go about selling courses. Should you use the Evergreen model? Or should you use a Product Launch approach?</p>



<p>In case you&#8217;ve missed the first six parts, here they are:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://chrislema.com/who-should-create-an-online-course-and-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who should build an online course</a></li><li><a href="https://chrislema.com/how-to-come-up-with-an-idea-for-your-online-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How do come up with an idea for your online course</a></li><li><a href="https://chrislema.com/how-to-structure-an-online-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to structure your online course</a></li><li><a href="https://chrislema.com/online-course-pre-requisites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All the pre-requisites before you launch</a></li><li><a href="https://chrislema.com/how-do-you-price-your-online-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How do you price your online course</a></li><li><a href="https://chrislema.com/the-gear-for-recording-your-online-course-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The gear for recording your online course</a></li></ol>



<p>So let&#8217;s figure out which strategy is best.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-benefits-of-the-evergreen-strategy">The benefits of the evergreen strategy</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve told you about my buddy&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/leftlane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shawn</a>&nbsp;and his evergreen course at&nbsp;<a href="https://wp101.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP101</a>. His course is always available. He never has to do the big production work of a product launch because people can buy his courses 365 days of the year.</p>



<p>One benefit of this approach is that he can step away from his work for a day or two when it freezes in Houston (it really did happen this year), and not worry that his business will fall apart. You can&#8217;t be in the middle of a two-week launch and skip out.</p>



<p>Another benefit of the evergreen approach is that money comes in the door every month. There is no feast / famine dynamic like you might experience with a product launch approach.</p>



<p>Additionally, there&#8217;s a lot less work involved when he adds a course to his platform. He doesn&#8217;t have to create webinars, funnels and more to “launch” anything.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-people-love-product-launches">Why people love product launches</h2>



<p>My friend&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferbourn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jen</a>&nbsp;works the opposite way with&nbsp;<a href="https://jenniferbourn.com/profitable-project-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Profitable Project Plan</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://jenniferbourn.com/content-camp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Content Camp</a>. These have specific open and close dates. PPP runs once a year, while she opens up registration for Content Camp twice a year.</p>



<p>One benefit to her approach is that there&#8217;s a natural scarcity that helps sell each program. There&#8217;s a window and most people buy the first or the last day – either eager for registration to open, or stressed that it will close without them.</p>



<p>Another benefit of the product launch model is that you bring in all the funds in a pretty tight window. Not saying you can&#8217;t have installment plans, which she does, but most people enjoy the benefit of a rapid infusion of cash into their bank accounts.</p>



<p>Additionally, when Jen isn&#8217;t in a launch, she doesn&#8217;t have to do any marketing. She&#8217;s free to enjoy her life and not worry that she has to be top of mind to get people to come her way and buy something.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-single-right-way-when-it-comes-to-selling-courses">Is there a single right way when it comes to selling courses?</h2>



<p>As you can see, both models work. When it comes to selling courses, there&#8217;s no specific strategy that is right, while the other is wrong. There are multiple approaches and you have to pick the one that makes most sense for you.</p>



<p>But how do you know which one is right for you?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Is-there-a-single-right-way-when-it-comes-to-selling-courses-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-55013"/></figure>



<p>Let me suggest that how you answer these three questions will help you figure that out.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-three-factors-to-help-you-choose-which-strategy-is-right-for-you">The three factors to help you choose which strategy is right for you</h2>



<p>The first factor is&nbsp;<strong>the kind of course you&#8217;re creating</strong>. If you&#8217;re creating a workshop like Jennifer, if you need a group of people to work together, group projects or learn in a cohort – then you should do product launches.</p>



<p>If your program is independent like Shawn&#8217;s, self-paced, and doesn&#8217;t require the interaction with anyone else, then you might want to look at the evergreen model.</p>



<p>The second question is about&nbsp;<strong>how you handle your finances</strong>. I know, that&#8217;s delicate. And you don&#8217;t have to say anything to anyone about it. But look in the mirror and decide how you will handle each situation.</p>



<p>People who are fine with finite moments of larger infusions of cash will enjoy the launch model, while those who want regularity of income will enjoy the evergreen model.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important. If you start with product launches, and then need more money, what are you likely to do? Create another program and do another launch. And then suddenly your email list is getting hammered every other month with a different launch you&#8217;re running.</p>



<p>It will create launch fatigue and shrink your list.</p>



<p>Lastly, when it comes to selling courses and picking the right model for you, you have to ask yourself&nbsp;<strong>what kind of marketer are you</strong>.</p>



<p>There are people who are very comfortable doing a decent amount of work in a short, timed window, to drive people to a launch but frankly don&#8217;t love marketing. Those folks will prefer a launch model simply because when it&#8217;s over, it&#8217;s over. And again, the scarcity helps close people.</p>



<p>For folks that are more comfortable with a consistent marketing effort, an evergreen model may make more sense as there&#8217;s no big pressure at any given time to drive sales. Plus, if you feel a bit uncomfortable with the “scarcity” that doesn&#8217;t feel as scarce in a digital world, an evergreen model may feel better to you.</p>



<h2>The choice is yours</h2>



<p>Which approach you take is up to you. Both work. How you answer those questions will help you decide. But either way, there&#8217;s some work to do.</p>



<p>Are you working on a course? Hit me up (there&#8217;s a&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact link</a>&nbsp;on my site) and let me know what you&#8217;re up to and what questions you have.</p>

<h2>To become a successful online educator, your learners have to have a successful experience in your course.</h2>



<p>If you’ve spent much time in the world of online learning, you’ve probably noticed that there’s a lot of industry advice out there about <a href="https://www.learndash.com/3-ways-to-grow-your-online-course-business/">how to grow your course</a>: how to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-raise-the-price-of-your-online-course/">price it effectively</a>, how to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/email-marketing-best-practices-for-online-educators/">manage your email marketing lists</a>, how to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-research-your-course-audience/">market your course to new audiences</a>, how to create an <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-kinds-of-promotions-to-boost-your-course-sales/">effective sales strategy</a>, and so on and so forth.</p>



<p>There’s nothing wrong with these articles—we’ve written many like them ourselves. But one thing which has bothered me at times when looking at online learning platforms that focus heavily on their sales tools is how many of them neglect the most fundamental feature of any Learning Management System (LMS): the ability to launch a good course.</p>



<p>Part of the problem is the assumption that all it takes to&nbsp;<em>teach</em>&nbsp;is to&nbsp;<em>know</em>. But being a subject matter expert, doesn’t automatically make you an expert teacher. Neither does giving a good presentation, or writing a good essay.</p>



<p>Of course, good communication and writing skills will help you be an effective teacher. But these skills are&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;skills, and your learners need opportunities to exercise their own if they are going to succeed.</p>



<p>This is what LMSs miss when they put all their focus on <a href="https://www.learndash.com/lms-comparison-learndash-vs-teachable/">features like video hosting</a> but <a href="https://www.learndash.com/lms-comparison-learndash-vs-thinkific/">don’t offer decent quiz settings</a>, or when they <a href="https://www.learndash.com/lms-comparison-learndash-vs-kajabi/">invest in tools to help their users sell courses</a> but have few options to help learners learn.</p>



<p>And yet, given the surplus of learning platforms that seem to make their bread and butter off tools that have nothing to do with learning, it seems plenty of them are finding success by diverting user focus away from building corses and toward selling them.</p>



<p>The truth is that putting learner experience first is good for your learners, and it’s also good for you. Here’s why.</p>



<h3>1. A good learner experience is good for everyone.</h3>



<p>Most educators get into online education because they’re good at what they do and want to share it with others. While I’m sure it’s alluring to think you could earn a decent amount of money just by sharing what you already know, I think a lot of people would be disappointed to discover that the people who signed up for their course didn’t take anything away from it. Call it ego, but the first reason educators should care about learner experience is because it will help them be better at their job.</p>



<p>Learners who have a good experience also stand to benefit a lot. Not only did they have a good course, but a good experience is linked to good outcomes. If you took a course that engaged you, challenged you, and ultimately left you feeling a sense of confidence and accomplishment, it’s probably because you actually learned things from that course.</p>



<p>Learners who succeed in learning things—and who had a good time in the process—are going to be more enthusiastic about sharing their progress with others. They’ll leave reviews, recommend the course to their friends, and sign up for more courses.</p>



<p>The flip side, of course, is that a course which fails to help them learn won’t receive reviews (not positive ones, in any case), won’t get referred, and won’t attract repeat learners. So creating a positive experience isn’t just good for you and your learners—it’s good for your bottom line, too.</p>



<h3>2. Online learning is not the same as in-person learning.</h3>



<p>An educator who is successful teaching in-person courses sometimes struggles when they begin teaching online. That’s because many of the teaching techniques that work well in-person don’t translate. An educator may be used to leading in-class discussions, may have certain exercises they perform with their group, or may simply be better at reading and responding to a live audience.</p>



<p>Even educators who don’t have in-person teaching experience may be drawing on their own memories of in-person classes when they go to design their own course. In the process, they could be building their course on false footing.</p>



<p>For educators who want to optimize their course for online audiences, a focus on learner experience can help them make the necessary adjustments. You can’t pause your lecture to start a class discussion, but you can encourage comments. You can find creative ways to adjust your exercises to digital formats, and you can look for new ways to engage your audience even if you aren’t in the room with them.</p>



<h3>3. Learner experience goes beyond learning content.</h3>



<p>Finally, by focusing on learner experience, educators can find new ways to enrich their course beyond the raw materials being presented. After all, for many learners, the content is almost a secondary concern. Of equal importance is the community they can connect to, and the support they receive along the way.</p>



<p>Online learning is <a href="https://www.learndash.com/does-your-course-suffer-from-learner-burnout/">notoriously isolating for many learners</a>, especially those who have no other options. One of the biggest reasons learners burn out and fail to continue a course is lack of support. If all you’re focused on is your subject matter, you could be losing learners who need that extra bit of attention. Providing <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-ways-provide-student-support-e-learning/">a better experience</a> will get them there.</p>



<h3>First come the sales, then come the reviews.</h3>



<p>I have no doubt that the tools offered by some of these sales-focused LMSs can help their users sell courses. I have less confidence that those courses will provide a good learning experience to those who buy them. And that has nothing to do with the knowledge level or expertise of the course creators.</p>



<p>Knowing and teaching are different skills. If you’re going to be successful as an educator, you need more than a mastery of your subject matter. You also need to present that material in a way that will stick with your learners.</p>



<p>If you’ve built an online course but are struggling to find learners who complete it, leave raving reviews, and go on to tell all their friends, then your challenge may have less to do with the information you’re presenting as the format you’re using to present it.</p>



<p>The solution is to build a course that focuses on learner experience. A better experience leads to more success, and if your course helps your learners meet their goals, they’ll remember it.</p>

<h2>How to create an effective email newsletter that won’t end up in the spam folder.</h2>



<p>Email newsletters are a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-popular-email-marketing-services-compared/">popular marketing tactic</a> for a good reason: subscribers like them, and they&#8217;re effective. However, this is only true if marketers follow the right best practices. All email newsletters are not created equal, and it&#8217;s far too easy for businesses to cut corners in the hope of reaching a wider audience, only to be disappointed when their spam reports go through the roof.</p>



<p>For online educators, creating an email newsletter can be a valuable tool. But if you want to avoid the pitfalls of unsuccessful newsletters, it&#8217;s wise to follow these <a href="https://www.learndash.com/email-marketing-best-practices-for-online-educators/">best practices</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/180602-10-Best-Practices-for-Creating-an-Email-Newsletter-1024x512.jpg" alt="A man sits with a laptop in his lap looking at an email on his computer screen." class="wp-image-28834" width="768" height="384" srcset="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/180602-10-Best-Practices-for-Creating-an-Email-Newsletter-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/180602-10-Best-Practices-for-Creating-an-Email-Newsletter-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/180602-10-Best-Practices-for-Creating-an-Email-Newsletter-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/180602-10-Best-Practices-for-Creating-an-Email-Newsletter-500x250.jpg 500w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/180602-10-Best-Practices-for-Creating-an-Email-Newsletter.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<h3>1. Tell your subscribers what they’re signing up for.</h3>



<p>First of all, to gain newsletter subscriptions, you&#8217;ll need to convince visitors to sign up to your mailing list. Few people will hand over their email address for no reason, and even if they do, they may be unhappy to discover themselves on your mailing list without their permission.</p>



<p>If you want to win over subscribers, make a clear and inviting statement about what your mailing list provides. It can be something as simple as: &#8220;To hear about our latest course updates and study tips, sign up for our weekly newsletter.&#8221; In one short sentence, this describes the frequency and general content of the newsletter. It doesn&#8217;t have to be more complicated than that.</p>



<h3>2. Use reCAPTCHA and double opt-in.</h3>



<p>Most of us know CAPTCHA as those squiggly words in a box that are hard to read and frustrating to use. A better option is reCAPTCHA, a user-friendly version developed by Google that uses check boxes or simple math problems (think: 1+1=?). These will limit the number of fake bot subscriptions and keep your lists healthy.</p>



<p>Similarly, double opt-ins are insurance to make sure the people who subscribed to your list actually want to be on it. Some marketers avoid them in the belief that the added step will scare away subscribers, but there aren&#8217;t many people who will change their minds or be overly deterred by verifying their subscription. And if they are, it&#8217;s probably as sign they weren&#8217;t all that interested in the first place.</p>



<h3>3. Be transparent about how you will use their data.</h3>



<p>Data transparency is a growing concern, particularly when it comes to online marketing. The Greater Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) from the EU stipulate that companies must be open with their users about how the data of EU citizens are being used. This could apply to small companies (which include certification businesses) if they have subscribers who are EU citizens.</p>



<p>To be safe, make sure that anyone who subscribes to your list understands that you will be using their email for marketing purposes, and that you won&#8217;t be sharing their data (which includes their email address) in any illicit way.</p>



<h3>4. Test subject lines and introductions.</h3>



<p>When you write your emails, use different subject lines with each newsletter. If you use the same subject line every time, your subscribers will start to ignore them. While you&#8217;re at it, test out different kinds of subject lines. Avoid using words like &#8220;free,&#8221; &#8220;now,&#8221; exclamation marks, or anything else that sounds like spam. Similarly, test out the opening line of your email to see what holds attention.</p>



<h3>5. Make sure they are mobile friendly.</h3>



<p>About two thirds of email in the US is opened and read on smart phones. This means that if your email is formatted in a way that doesn&#8217;t read well on mobile, it won&#8217;t serve your readers. To keep your emails mobile-friendly, avoid overly-formatted templates. Keep your subjects about 40–50 characters long, your images under 600px wide, and stick to single-column formats.</p>



<h3>6. Use segmentation to deliver more targeted messages.</h3>



<p>Email segmentation means splitting a list into sub segments to target more niche audiences. For instance, if you have two or three online programs on your site but only one general email list, you could segment that list so that if you wanted to send out a newsletter that was about only one of those programs, you would only be emailing learners of that course.</p>



<p>That said, you have to be careful with segmentation. You can&#8217;t take those users off the list they signed up for and move them to one they didn&#8217;t sign up for. If someone signed up for your weekly email newsletter about course updates and study tips and suddenly starts receiving daily sales messages, they&#8217;ll understandably feel tricked.</p>



<h3>7. Balance your content to be 90% informational.</h3>



<p>Email newsletters are an excellent way to grow a sales list, but they should primarily be about providing your subscribers with the kind of information that will give them a reason to stay. Very few people subscribe to an email list so that they can receive promotional emails every morning. Instead, they&#8217;re looking for something of value. That&#8217;s what you have to give them.</p>



<h3>8. Let your subscribers adjust content type and frequency.</h3>



<p>Give your subscribers an easy way to manage the kinds of emails they receive. If you&#8217;re using list segmentation properly, then they shouldn&#8217;t be receiving anything they didn&#8217;t sign up for. However, they may decide after some time that they want to receive fewer emails, or only emails on certain topics. Let your subscribers see which segmented lists they&#8217;re on, and make it easy for them to remove themselves from those lists.</p>



<h3>9. Make unsubscribing easy.</h3>



<p>There may come a time when someone who was once a subscriber no longer wants to receive your emails. You&#8217;ve probably been that person yourself on someone else&#8217;s marketing list. It&#8217;s not a good use of your time to continue marketing to people who don&#8217;t want to hear from you, and it&#8217;s likely to lead to resentment if you do. Your goal in creating an email newsletter is to have a list of people who want to hear from you—not one that&#8217;s full of disinterested leads who delete your emails unread whenever they land in their inbox.</p>



<p>To build the list you want, make it easy for users to unsubscribe. Put the button in the footer of your email, and don&#8217;t try to bury it in the fine print where it&#8217;s hard to locate. When they do go to unsubscribe, don&#8217;t burden them with questions or ask them to stay—just let them unsubscribe.</p>



<h3>10. Deliver on your promises.</h3>



<p>Creating an email newsletter is one thing. Sustaining it is another. It&#8217;s far too easy to put a subscribe button on your website and never do anything with it. Worse, you may collect a few hundred emails over the course of the year, but by the time you go to send them a newsletter they could have gotten second thoughts, changed email addresses, or forgotten they signed up in the first place.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re going to do your email newsletters well, deliver what you say you will. If you say you&#8217;re sending a weekly update, send it once a week. If you say it&#8217;s going to be about your courses and study tips, make sure it is. And if you start to change your newsletter to something different, tell your subscribers and ask them to sign up for the new list. Those who still want to hear from you will come along.</p>

<h2>You’re selling an online course. Does your copy focus on what your course offers, or what your course can help learners achieve?</h2>



<p>Recently, I wrote a blog post on <a href="https://www.learndash.com/4-tips-for-writing-better-sales-copy-for-your-online-course/">copywriting tips </a>that can help online educators sell their courses more effectively. One of the points I touched on was the difference between course benefits and features, and why speaking to course benefits is a good way to get learners interested in your course.</p>



<p>The difference between the two can be nuanced, so I thought it would be worthwhile to discuss it further, especially as understanding your course benefits is key to successful marketing messaging on a high level, and features are critical to helping you close.</p>



<p>In marketing speak, the difference between a &#8220;benefit&#8221; and a &#8220;feature&#8221; is that the benefit is a learner&#8217;s end goal. Features are how the learner will get there.</p>



<p>For LearnDash, we might say that a benefit of our plugin is that educators will be able to create online courses, earn an income that will give them more financial freedom, and share something they&#8217;re passionate about with the world. Those are all benefits that a successful educator can gain through building a course with our plugin. The features we offer to help them do that include things like &#8220;advanced quizzes&#8221; or &#8220;dripfeed content.&#8221;</p>



<p>Educators will need to understand both their benefits and their features in order to market their course. But knowing when and how to use them has a huge impact on how many learners a course will attract, and how effective an educator will be at selling to them. Here&#8217;s why.</p>



<h3>1. Learners need a reason to care about the course before they will care about its features.</h3>



<p>Imagine trying to sell a course by telling someone about all the amazing webinars, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-use-cases-for-branching-scenarios-in-online-learning/">branching scenarios</a>, and quizzes you&#8217;re going to offer, but without mentioning what your course is about? It sounds ridiculous, but it&#8217;s a problem many course creators fall into (although not to that extreme). They begin with the assumption that learners already understand the benefits of a course, without having established them.</p>



<p>The reality, is that some of your learners will understand the value of your course rather quickly, but others will need more of an explanation. They might see how your course would be good for someone—but not recognize how it might help them.</p>



<h3>2. Different benefits will resonate with different learners.</h3>



<p>Another important note about benefits: They won&#8217;t be the same for everyone. Say you&#8217;re trying to teach a language course: Some learners will want to learn so that they can be prepared for a foreign trip. Others will want to enhance their business skills. Still others will have academic interests, like being able to write or appreciate foreign media.</p>



<p>Emphasizing a range of benefits that your course provides can help you attract more learners. It&#8217;s also a good way to find subsets of your audience who might have different needs. Someone learning a language for travel will have a different learning path from one who is learning for business, and you can create different materials to appeal to each.</p>



<h2>So when should sales copy focus on features?</h2>



<p>Once your learners are all-in on the benefits you offer, talking about features can help convince them to sign on. The enthusiasm a learner has for reaching a goal will make them more interested in how you plan to help them get there.</p>



<h3>1. Features will speak more meaningfully to learners who have done more research.</h3>



<p>In marketing, we often talk about the &#8220;buyer&#8217;s journey,&#8221; or the path someone takes from being uninformed about a product to being ready to buy. The stages to from &#8220;pain aware,&#8221; to &#8220;solution aware,&#8221; and finally to &#8220;brand aware.&#8221; In practice that looks like this:</p>



<p>You might never have thought about wanting to take a course in meditation, but now that you&#8217;ve seen an add talking about how many people struggle to concentrate at work, you realize this is a problem you have, too. (Pain aware.) You learn that meditation can help free the mind of distractions by providing an intentional period of rest during the busy work day. You think about reading a book or downloading an app, but ultimately decide you want to take a mediation class. (Solution aware.) You research various online courses, and eventually discover one that offers daily ten-minute lessons that will fit into your lunch break. (Brand aware.)</p>



<p>Benefits-based language helps learners recognize a need and convince them of a solution. But the further a learner goes down the buyer&#8217;s journey, they more specifics they want to know before they will make a decision.</p>



<h3>2. Features can help differentiate your course from the competition.</h3>



<p>Specifics are important because they help a learner decide between two similar options. This is where features are crucial in closing a sale. Remember that many learners, especially online, will look up at least one other option before settling on a purchase. They want to be sure that what they&#8217;re looking at is the best solution for them. If you and a competitor are both selling similar courses, you are probably also talking about similar benefits.</p>



<p>However, the specific features can be what sets you apart. If you are offering something with your course that your competitor doesn&#8217;t, it can be the deciding factor in your favor.</p>



<h3>3. Features are more concrete and specific, and that will make your benefits claims more credible.</h3>



<p>Finally, while benefits are lofty and inspirational, features show that you have the means and the method to deliver on what you promise. Benefits are the destination, features are the map.</p>



<h3>Benefits and features aren’t an “either/or” but a “both/and.” The key is when to use them.</h3>



<p>As should be clear by now, you need to show earners both the benefits of taking your course, and the features that will help them get there, if you want to land a sale. They key is to make sure benefits come first. If a learner doesn&#8217;t see the benefit, they will never care about the features. But once you&#8217;ve shown the benefit, learners need to know the features to make the final decisions. Convince learners of the benefits, and the features can back you up.</p>

<h2>It’s not enough to just build a great course—you have to sell it, too.</h2>



<p>Many online educators create courses because they have a passion and want to share it. And, of course, that’s a fantastic and inspirational thing to see. But many educators, after creating their courses, run into a wall: their excitement carried them through the creation stage of their journey, and now they need to move into sales mode. The only problem is, they don’t know how.</p>



<p>This phenomenon shouldn’t be surprising. After all, we should all be able to recognize that creating a course and <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-increase-conversions-and-maximize-course-sales/">selling a course</a> are different skills, and switching hats isn’t easy.</p>



<p>What is easy is tricking yourself into thinking that a great course will sell itself. We would all like to think that our greatness is instantly recognizable, but the truth is that competition is tough, and learners are looking for something that speaks directly to their needs.</p>



<p>Good sales copy can do that. And since copy is going to be the primary way you sell your course online, taking time to do it right is worth the effort. Here’s some tips to get you started.</p>



<h3>1. Don’t write copy you don’t want to read.</h3>



<p>All of us have seen bad sales copy. It&#8217;s the kind that includes overblown promises (&#8220;opportunity of a lifetime!&#8221;) or vacuous statements (&#8220;everything you want and more!&#8221;) and generally just feels pushy and irritating to read (“don’t miss this amazing opportunity buy now!!!!!!!”). And yet, for some reason, many excellent online business owners, when they go to write their sales copy, fall into these same writing traps. Why?</p>



<p>I suspect it&#8217;s because these business owners believe on some level that they have to use this kind of writing to attract learners. They want to sell courses, and they believe that &#8220;sales-heavy&#8221; copy is the way to do it.</p>



<p>The problem is that most professional sales people don&#8217;t write that way, because irritating a customer isn’t a good sales strategy—especially when all they need to do to get away from you is to close a browser tab. If you’re writing copy you hate because you think that’s what you need to do to sell a course, it’s time to step back and re-evaluate.</p>



<h4>A few sales copywriting mistakes to avoid:</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Too many vague or fluffy words.</strong> You’ll hear many people say you shouldn’t use too many adjectives or adverbs—or just too many words in general—but I don’t find this helpful. The problem isn’t the quantity of words, but the quality. Avoid puffy words (“amazing,” “incredible,” “super”), and instead chose more specific words related to your content.</li><li><strong>Too many exclamation points.</strong> Start by using none. Then, if you come back to your copy after a day and still feel like you need to add one or two, go ahead. Never use all caps in your body copy.</li><li><strong>Too many jargon words.</strong> If you’re creating an advanced course for industry professionals, technical terms are fine (and even desirable!). But if you’re writing for a new audience, using a lot of jargon words to sound impressive will be off-putting.</li><li><strong>Avoid hyperbole and clichés.</strong> Don’t make claims you can’t back up, and don’t learn on the clichés you’ve heard everyone else use. If your copy could be cut and pasted onto your competitor’s website without anyone noticing the difference, it’s not doing enough to stand out.</li><li><strong>Don’t make it all about yourself.</strong> Your learners want to know why your course is going to help them. If you aren’t speaking to their concerns, they won’t stick around to find out why you’re so special.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Choose your audience.</h3>



<p>One common mistake course creators fall into when they begin working on their course sales copy is the belief that their course is “for everyone.” The reality is that it’s not even for all the people who may be interested in learning about your subject matter.</p>



<p>This can be counterintuitive for some educators, because as teachers they want to share their knowledge with a broad audience, and as business owners they want to sell as many courses as possible. But being more selective about the kind of learner who will be a good fit for your course will actually lead to higher quality sales down the way—which in turn will mean happier learners and less stress for you.</p>



<h4>Some factors that may make a learner a good or bad fit for your course include:</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Budget.</strong> Can they afford to take your course? Conversely, is your course not expensive <em>enough</em>, because they want more features and content?</li><li><strong>Involvement.</strong> Does the learner expect a lot of personal engagement with you? Some educators want to be hands off (and sell their courses to more people at a lower cost) while others want to be more like mentors (and sell fewer courses at a higher cost).</li><li><strong>Subject level.</strong> Are you teaching a beginner course, or a course for advanced students?</li><li><strong>Demographics.</strong> Are you teaching to learners of a specific age? Are race, gender, or sexual orientation relevant factors?</li></ul>



<p>Being more specific about your course actually improves your ability to sell to <em>that audience</em>, even if it means you lose out on people who don’t fall into <a href="https://www.learndash.com/do-niche-online-courses-sell/">your niche</a>. Take these two examples for a business leadership course:</p>



<ul><li>A $50 online course for recent college graduates who want to improve their hiring prospects. (Low budget, low involvement, beginning subject level, young learners.)</li><li>A $500 private online seminar for women who are preparing for a C-suite promotion. (High budget, high involvement, advanced subject level, women with 15–20 years of job experience.)</li></ul>



<p>Either of these options will naturally lead to more compelling sales copy for your online course, just by defining an audience.</p>



<h3>3. Describe your benefits first, your features second.</h3>



<p>Once you’ve defined who your audience is, start listing how your course benefits them. A lot of sales copy focuses too much on features—and features are good. But features aren’t benefits, if they don’t bring value to the learner.</p>



<p>For instance, a “feature” might be something like “daily quizzes,” “community forum,” or “one-on-one consultation.” Being specific about what your course offers is important, but only to students who are already in the market for what your course teaches. Or in other words, features are the means to an end, but unless the learner cares about the end, the means won’t matter.</p>



<p>Benefits are what your learners want to be able to achieve after they take your course. Using the example of the business leadership from before, that benefit might be something like “negotiate a higher salary” or “earn a promotion.”</p>



<p>Another way to think of this is the “why” and “how.” Benefits are the “why.” They’re the reason your learners are signing up for your course in the first place. Features are how they get there.</p>



<p>Put yet another way, benefits are the motivation, and features are the method. Learners will have varying motivations that push them to take your course, so you should think about the range of motivations, and then tie your features in to how your course will help them achieve their goals.</p>



<h4>Examples of benefits vs. features:</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Benefits (motivation):</strong> Learn to speak French!<br><strong>Features (method):</strong> Daily vocabulary quizzes.<br></li><li><strong>Benefit (why):</strong> Sleep more soundly and feel more refreshed during the day.<br><strong>Feature (how):</strong> Guided meditation practices.<br></li><li><strong>Benefit (ends):</strong> Gain support from a network of fellow professionals.<br><strong>Feature (means):</strong> Community forum.</li></ul>



<h3>4. Address hesitations and offer proof.</h3>



<p>Finally, a learner may be very interested in your course, but have specific concerns that are holding them back. Maybe they’re not sure your method will work, and want to have some examples of your course in action to feel more confident. Maybe they aren’t sure they’ll be able to fit the course into their schedule, and want to know if they can get a refund if they can’t find the time to do the work. Or maybe they’re not sure the course is a good fit for them, and want a chance to talk about their needs with you before they get started.</p>



<p>There can be any number of reasons a learner might hesitate, and any number of <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-earn-social-proof-for-your-online-course/">proofs</a> you can offer to set their mind at ease. You don’t need to offer everything, especially as some options are more expensive and may not be economical for you to provide. But you should consider what you can offer, and be proactive in advertising it.</p>



<h4>Ways to address hesitations and offer proof:</h4>



<ul><li>Money back guarantee during trial period.</li><li>15-minute scheduled consultation call.</li><li>Free mini course.</li><li>Learner reviews and case studies.</li></ul>



<h3>You’re going to be selling your course through your sales copy, so give it the love it deserves.</h3>



<p>Selling online education courses is a different business from many others, because your sales copy will be doing a lot more heavy lifting. Your learners are more likely to be finding you through Google or social media, and they won’t have any other frame of reference to know who you are or what you do.</p>



<p>Taking extra time to go over your copy and make sure the messaging aligns with what your learners need from your course is well worth the effort. If you put them first in your copy, you’re already well on your way to demonstrating that you’ll be putting their needs first in your course as well.</p>

<h2>How do you convince learners who have never heard of you that you’re an expert in your subject area?</h2>



<p>The biggest challenge of any course creator, once they’ve built an online course, is to get learners to sign up. Many creators fixate on questions about pricing models, advertising, marketing, and the like, convinced that all they have to do is get the right message with the right price tag in front of enough people to get them to sign up for their course.</p>



<p>But for many educators, the biggest problem is a much more difficult one to handle: Trust. Learners don’t want to risk sinking their money into a bad course. And even if that course were free, they don’t want to waste their time on it if it’s not going to teach them what they want to know.</p>



<p>Getting learners to sign up is about more than attractive messaging and a tempting price point. It’s about establishing enough trust with your learners that they believe your course will be worth their time and money. Establishing that trust is not easy, but there are several methods you can follow to win learners over. Let’s take a look.</p>



<h3>1. Show your credentials: Talk about your history.</h3>



<p>I’ve listed this option first, because it’s the first one most people think of. After all, we’re all used to handing out resumés and listing our work history when we apply for jobs, so it’s only natural this would be our first instinct when we’re trying to attract an audience.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as anyone who’s tried to break into a field knows, getting experience for your first gig can be tough. If you don’t have an established history in your field yet, convincing others that you know enough to offer meaningful instruction can be a hard sell.</p>



<p>There’s another problem with this strategy, however: It’s weak. If all a new learner has to convince them that you’re a credible teacher is your own word, they are unlikely to be persuaded. Plenty of people inflate their experience, especially on the Internet. So while your credentials may be impressive, they won’t stand well on their own. For that, you need other trust signifiers.</p>



<h3>2. Social proof: Get others to vouch for you.</h3>



<p>You can’t vouch for yourself, but if others step up and give you a good reference, you’re much more likely to win over learners. In marketing, the various ways that others can vouch for you is called “social proof.” Social proof comes in a variety of forms, including testimonials, case studies, word-of-mouth referrals, or even graduated learners offering their participation in your course as their own form of credential.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-earn-social-proof-for-your-online-course/">Social proof</a> is highly persuasive to new learners, especially if they have a strong connection with the person who is referring your course. Just think about influencer marketing. It’s a whole sales strategy built on using social media to gain social proof.</p>



<p>However, if you’re new to course creation, you’ve probably already spotted the flaw with this method: You need learners to convince other learners that your course is worthwhile. Getting that first cohort of students through your course is key to having the feedback and testimonials you need to attract more students. So what can you do to get those first learners to sign up?</p>



<h3>3. Give it away: Offer a test period.</h3>



<p>“Free” is the most magical word in marketing. When it comes to your course, you obviously don’t want to give it away for free forever. But&#8230;</p>



<p>What about a free trial period?</p>



<p>What about offering your course for free to an early round of beta testers?</p>



<p>What about a free first lesson, or a free consultation?</p>



<p>Sometimes, the biggest challenge is just to get someone to give you a shot. Once they do try your course, they may realize it’s exactly what they want, and they’ll decide to sign on in order to have more of it.</p>



<p>At the worst, you can gain feedback from them about why your course is failing—and they’ll be more likely to give that feedback if they aren’t a disappointed customer. At best? They could become one of your biggest advocates.</p>



<h3>4. Demonstrate expertise: Show that you know what you’re talking about.</h3>



<p>There’s a reason <a href="https://www.learndash.com/tips-for-creating-a-course-content-marketing-strategy/">content marketing</a> has become the most successful online strategy of the last decade: It works. And the reason why it works is because it doesn’t take learner trust for granted. Instead of withholding information and expecting learners to place their faith in you without having seen your expertise, content marketing gives learners a sense for your teaching style and underlying point of view before they sign up for a course.</p>



<p>In many ways, it’s about transparency. Many educators are worried that if they share too much up front, learners won’t sign up for their course—or their competitors will steal all their good ideas. But the reality is that your perspective is not something others can easily replicate. There’s always more to share, and doing so will only grow your brand.</p>



<p>So: talk about your subject on your blog. Make YouTube videos. Learn how to Tweet. Wherever you feel most comfortable weighing in on issues relevant to your expertise, make it your platform and start sharing your knowledge. Do it well, and you’ll have learners begging for more.</p>



<h3>Build a reputation for quality course content, and that reputation will get you far.</h3>



<p>Trust isn’t built in a day, and winning over your first satisfied learners won’t happen overnight. The best thing you can do is to never take your learner’s trust for granted, and to expect to have to earn it by building a high-quality course, listening to their feedback, and revising and updating as you go.</p>



<p>Ad campaigns vanish once they money fueling them dries up. But the efforts you put into building loyalty with your learners won’t vanish in an instant. In fact, it’s likely to continue to grow as long as you continue to produce good resources.</p>
