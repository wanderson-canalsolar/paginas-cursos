<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash’ Stripe integration is the perfect solution for course creators with only a few courses that need a quick and easy payment system. It’s not just another payment gateway, it comes with features like automatic user creation and enrollment, Paypal compatibility, and lightbox overlays. Plus, we’ve added a few more necessary features to make selling your courses simpler than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more below.</span></p>
<h2><b>Benefits of Using Stripe With LearnDash</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time when you could only use Stripe with LearnDash if you had a third-party shopping cart, like </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/sell-your-learndash-courses-with-woocommerce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But we’re always growing and making our products better to give you and your learners the best course platform experience. We’ve added a few new features to make using Stripe more beneficial to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a quick look at some of the best reasons to use Stripe to sell your LearnDash courses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Automatic user creation and enrollment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your learners can get started faster with the automatic user creation and enrollment feature. Once a payment is complete, a user account is automatically created and your learner is enrolled in the course.</span></p>
<p><b>Coupon support</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coupon support is one of the latest features. You’re now able to create coupons to be used at checkout without needing to use one of the four major shopping carts add-ons.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Free trial support</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free trial offerings are a great way to increase your number of signups. Allow prospective learners to try now and pay later by simply checking out with the Stripe integration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Automatically retries and recaptures payments</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never worry about failed payment again. Stripe will automatically update saved cards, send emails after a failed payment occurs, and retry the payment at various strategic times.</span></p>
<p><b>Sell courses in bundles via group memberships</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you can increase your sales by offering your learners course bundles. The Stripe integration lets you group your courses while offering a seamless checkout experience. You can add courses or access to non-LearnDash pages as well.</span></p>
<p><b>3D Secure V2</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D Secure V2 are new security protocols that affect payment authorizations. If you’re super techy, you can learn more about it </span><a href="https://jak.dev/what-3ds-v2-and-sca-compliance-means-for-your-software-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Lightbox overlay capabilities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping learners on your site is super important for their learning experience. The lightbox overlay allows learners to stay on your site while making their purchase securely through Stripe.</span></p>
<h2><b>How To Configure Stripe With LearnDash</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll install the Stripe integration by logging into your account and downloading the plugin. After installing and activating the plugin, click the new “Stripe” tab located under </span><b>LEARNDASH LMS &gt; SETTINGS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add your Stripe account information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, add your course price and you&#8217;re ready to start selling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your potential learner clicks the “Take This Course” button, they’ll be prompted to enter their credit card information via Stripe. Additionally, they’ll also have the option to use Paypal if you have it enabled.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a detailed configuration walkthrough </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/stripe/)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you run into any issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stripe integration for LearnDash is perfect for course creators who need a simple payment system for their courses. The latest features expand the Stripe capabilities on your LearnDash course page to help you do more for less.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you tried the new Stripe integration? If so, how’s it going for you?</span></p>

<p>Creating a course can feel intimidating especially if this is your first attempt. What can make this task even more overwhelming is choosing the right equipment to record your online course videos. </p>



<p>You’ve probably spent hours watching “how-to” Youtube videos, browsing Amazon for the right tech, and budgeting your money so you can afford to make your course look as professional as possible.</p>



<p>You should know that it doesn’t take a lot of equipment or money to record content for your online course. You may already have exactly what you need to create clean, crisp, and professional online course videos. </p>



<p>Here are our recommendations for the best video equipment for recording an online course.</p>



<h3><strong>Create clear visuals with a smartphone or camera&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>How your videos look has a major impact on how the information you provide is received by your audience. But that doesn’t mean you need to purchase an expensive DSLR camera because most smartphones can shoot in 4K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smartphones have a limit on storage space which is a downside to using them instead of a camera. Keeping your videos 10 minutes or less than using your smartphone could be a cost-efficient way of recording your content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For videos over 10 minutes, we recommend splurging a bit on a quality camera. You can record a few hours of content without needing to free up storage space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonus: To improve viewer engagement, try using both a smartphone and a camera to capture different angles.</p>



<h3><strong>Reduce shaky videos with a tripod or stabilizer</strong></h3>



<p>No matter what type of course you’re creating, you’ll want to make sure your camera stays still and in focus. Low quality or poorly recorded videos can give your viewers a bad viewing experience and even lower <a href="https://www.learndash.com/9-ways-to-improve-your-course-completion-rate/">course completion rates</a>. </p>



<p>Tripods are best for videos that are shot in one location that doesn’t require any variation in movement. A stabilizer is best for content recorded on the go, like athletic training courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Get crisp audio with a mic and pop filters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Audio matters a lot when it comes to courses. For your course to be effective, your viewers need audio that is clear and free of any background noise or audio flaws.</p>



<p>To make sure your volume levels are consistent, use an external microphone instead of the one that’s built into your camera or phone. This is achieved by using an external mic. Additionally, this will help you record the audio separately from the video to make editing less tedious and confusing. </p>



<p>Sometimes when you’re recording, the mic will pick up extra air or noises from your mouth when you’re speaking. Using a pop filter can help reduce any unwanted air or noise.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Stay on track with a teleprompter app</strong></h3>



<p>During recording, it’s hard to stay on topic and reading your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-script-a-video-for-e-learning/">video script</a> from paper can be distracting to you and your viewers. A helpful hack is to use a teleprompter. </p>



<p>Don’t worry, you won’t have to go out and buy a real one. You can use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teleprompter-premium/id1533078079?mt=12">Teleprompter Premium +</a> app that’s available on most devices. All you have to do is upload your script.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Create seamless final videos with video editing software</strong></h3>



<p>The editing process will be different for everyone. To save time you can hire a video editor. But if you’re looking for a budget-friendly option, DIYing will be your best bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the best video editing software on the market is Adobe’s <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html">Premiere Elements</a>. It’s under $100 and super easy to use. If you need extra help you can always turn to Youtube. There are a plethora of Youtube videos that will walk you through the basics of video editing.</p>



<p>Even if this is your first rodeo with creating a course, LearnDash is always here to help you every step of the way. </p>

<h2>From new user flows to cleaner backend organization, LearnDash 3.6 reduces hassle while keeping the tools you need right where you can find them.</h2>



<p>It’s easy for educators online to become overwhelmed by the number of technical decisions they have to make in order to launch their course, as well as all the settings, options, and customizations each new tool comes with.</p>



<p>Given how many online tools there are (LMSs, CMSs, CRMs, social media networks, hosting sites, marketing automation tools, email tools, SEO tools, themes, security tools, etc.), any educator may quickly find themself working with over a dozen tools in order to create, launch, and maintain their course.</p>



<p>Almost all of this is inevitable. The only way around it is to try your luck with an “<a href="https://www.learndash.com/the-dangerous-myth-of-the-all-in-one-lms/">all-in-one</a>” option that will claim to deliver on half those options, and then only provide the most minimal support for each. However, what you <em>can</em> do is find tools that have good user experiences, so the time you take learning to use each of these tools is minimal.</p>



<p>That’s what we chose to focus on when we worked on the LearnDash 3.6 release. We wanted to offer a number of tools that would enhance the functionality of your course while also making it easier for our users to find what they need and accomplish their goals.</p>



<p>To that end, here are a few of the top new features from LearnDash 3.6 that improve the user experience for our users.</p>



<h3>1. The Advanced Tab.</h3>



<p>One of the classic problems of interface design is knowing which options need to be front and center, and which should be tucked away. Few interface problems are more frustrating than not being able to find a setting to turn on or off. At the same time, when there are too many settings to configure all in one place, it can overwhelm the users, making it even harder for them to find what they’re looking for.</p>



<p>In LearnDash 3.6, we’ve remedied this problem by taking options that most of our users don’t need to touch (or only need to touch one time), and moving them to a new Advanced tab. If you need to find information about custom labels, REST API, or data upgrades, it’s now in this tab. Other options that you need to access more often stay right where they are, where you can easily find them.</p>



<h3>2. Course Grid 2.0</h3>



<p>On the topic of new and improved user experience, the latest version of Course Grid is now Guttenberg compatible. That means you can insert it as a block in your page editor, then drag and drop it to where you’d like it to appear relative to other content blocks on the page. Displaying your courses where you want and how you want will be that much easier going forward.</p>



<p>The Course Grid 2.0 also includes new options to edit its appearance on your website. This includes new skins, new templates, and new elements you can choose to include or exclude. As a result, you’ll have more control over how your courses display on your site, and can fine-tune it to your heart’s content.</p>



<p>Last but not least, the course grid now includes filter options on the front end, so that your learners can search your courses according to pricing and taxonomy. This is huge for any organization with a large catalog of learning content, as it will improve the user experience for learners while also making it easier for them to showcase their content.</p>



<h3>3. New User Registration Flow.</h3>



<p>This is another request we’ve heard many times, and we’re excited to finally be able to deliver. When new users sign up for your course, you can now create a seamless registration flow with dedicated registration pages that automatically logs users in once they sign up.</p>



<p>This will cut down on confusion from new users and make it easier for them to start their course right away. And it’s worth pointing out: Less confusion for your users means fewer annoyed learners messaging you about why they can’t access their course right away.</p>



<h3>4. LearnDash Integrity.</h3>



<p>Finally, after you go through all the work of creating a new course, you want to be sure your content is safe, right? For most of our users, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-protect-your-course-from-content-theft/">this isn’t a huge concern</a>. It takes a lot of work to steal content, and many users are more interested in purchasing the real deal from a creator they trust rather than try to hunt down plagiarized material from someone else. However, pirated content is pirated content, and while it’s impossible (or at least unfeasible) to completely prevent someone from stealing your materials, you can make it harder.</p>



<p>To that end, we’ve now made it easier for you to protect your intellectual property. LearnDash Integrity comes with hotlink protection, which prevents third-party websites from directly linking to your content and eating up all your bandwidth. It also makes it harder for users to copy your content, and prevents concurrent logins.</p>



<h3>Your hard work should go toward your course.</h3>



<p>It’s hard work to launch an online course, but the payoff for most educators is incredibly rewarding. You get to share your expertise with people who recognize its value and are willing to pay you what it’s worth.</p>



<p>We want to make sure that your hard work goes where it will do the most good—not struggling with a user interface, or placating irritated customers, or trying to research ways to fight content pirates. The more we can do to make everything that <em>isn’t</em> creating your course fade into the background, the more energy you will have for delivering the knowledge you’re known for.</p>



<p>We think that experience must feel pretty great.</p>

<h2>The latest update allows for new ways for you to present your course to learners.</h2>



<p>We hope you’ve heard by now about our release of <a href="https://www.learndash.com/learndash-version-3-6-is-here/">LearnDash 3.6</a>. It’s an exciting update to our platform with a number of much-requested features, as well as a few new ones that we think our users will love.</p>



<p>That said, it’s one thing to read about a new feature and other thing to know how to apply it to your course. So with that in mind, I’d like to take a closer look at three of the features that can give you an edge when selling and marketing your course. As always, you can read about how these features work in more detail on our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/">documentation</a>.</p>



<h3>1. Subscription payments.</h3>



<p>The most exciting update for most of our users is the new subscription payment option. Our new recurring payments option makes it easier for you to set a billing interval for your course, and to set a trial period so that learners can get a taste of what you have to offer before they dive in.</p>



<p>This has been one of our most-requested additions for a long time, so we’re excited to finally include it in our LearnDash core offerings. Before now, users have had to use a separate plugin to enable this feature. While some of those plugins offer advanced features that may be valuable to some users, they are no longer necessary for users who want to sell their course by subscription.</p>



<p>We’ve talked in the past about the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/should-you-use-a-subscription-pricing-strategy/">benefits of offering subscriptions for your course</a>, and how they can help bring in hesitant learners. Subscriptions lower the barrier-to-entry on a course, making it easier for learners to justify paying $10/mo. rather than $100 up front. Plus, it’s easier to sell learners on a pricing structure they’re familiar with (Netflix!). If you’re offering a course that includes a lot of fresh, original content, this pricing structure is essential.</p>



<h3>2. Per-course redirects.</h3>



<p>Where do your learners go after they register and enroll in one of your courses? The obvious answer for most educators is that you want them to be redirected to the course main page, so they can start learning while their engagement is high.</p>



<p>However, the moment after a learner enrolls is a time when you know you have their full attention. They’ve just completed a purchase, they’re clearly invested in your material, and if you wait to engage them on another day, you risk catching them when they’re tired, stressed, or otherwise uninterested.</p>



<p>So, instead of sending them straight to the course page, think about whether this can be another marketing opportunity. Per-course redirects allow you to build landing pages specifically tailored to appear to leaners after they complete the registration and enrollment process. You can use the same URL for each course, or customize them based on what course your learner enrolled in.</p>



<p>For instance, you can use these pages to:</p>



<ul><li>Suggest other, related courses that they may want to enroll in.</li><li>Offer a special discount code.</li><li>Offer a reduced rate on an add-on or micro course.</li><li>Pitch your one-on-one coaching sessions.</li><li>Direct learners to resources they need to download before they begin.</li><li>Welcome them to your course and encourage them to follow/subscribe to you elsewhere.</li></ul>



<p>Your most valuable customers are the ones you already have. The learner who has just purchased a course is more likely to purchase another course than a lead who has come in cold. Per-course redirects let you pitch to new leads when they’re still flaming hot.</p>



<h3>3. New email settings.</h3>



<p>Finally, we’ve added a new option for sending emails to your learners, located under a new tab which you can find by following: wp-admin &gt; LearnDash LMS &gt; Settings &gt; Emails. This allows you to send email based on specific triggers (“Course Purchase Success,” “Group Purchase Success,” or “New User Registration”) so that new learners have the confirmation they need that their purchase and registration process was a success. You can even update the “from” name of your emails so that it doesn’t say “WordPress,” without having to install a separate plugin.</p>



<p>This may not seem like marketing, but it does have a lot to do presenting a good brand image. Modern buyers are used to seeing confirmation emails in their inbox when they purchase something. It’s a subtle reassurance that what they wanted to happen did, in fact, happen. The more smoothly that process takes place, the greater credibility you have with them as an educator.</p>



<p>It’s also important that, when they receive emails from you, those emails come <em>from you</em>. A learner who signs up for your course who then receives a confirmation email from WordPress may wonder if they made some kind of mistake. By having your own name on the email, it increases the professionalism of your communication.</p>



<h3>A smooth presentation means a more professional appearance.</h3>



<p>At the end of the day, one of the most important qualities you can market to your learners is <em>professionalism</em>. Professionalism establishes your own authority, and helps build trust with learners. It sets you apart from those who are selling low-quality content, and demonstrates that you pay attention to the details so that your learners have a great experience.</p>



<p>That kind of quality is something you can market—both to learners who buy your course and get to experience it for themselves, and to learners who are on the fence.</p>

<p>What came first, the <a href="http://www.learndash.com/lms-plugin-membership-plugin-or-both/">membership plugin or the LMS</a>? We get questions about both constantly. Our users want to know if our LMS will protect their content the way a membership plugin does, or they want to know if they need a membership plugin to manage the users on their course. Sometimes they’ve just heard the phrase “membership plugin” mentioned so many times that they are convinced they must need it—even though they don’t really know what it is.</p>
<p>Membership is a big part of online learning, but it’s not integral to it. At the same time, many users can get the key benefits of a membership plugin without needing to install one on their site. But there are also cases where only a membership plugin will do, and educators have to understand what those situations are in order to make the best choices for their course and for their learners.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s jump in and take a closer look.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the difference between a membership site and an LMS?</h3>
<p>Membership sites and LMSs have a lot in common—enough so that many people get them confused. However, despite the extensive overlap, there are some use cases wherein you might need an LMS, but not a membership plugin, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For instance, if you are offering an open course that anyone can take without having to formally register, you wouldn’t need a membership site. For example, if you’ve ever filled out an online personality quiz, or taken part in an informal online survey, you’ve used the same quiz functionality offered by an LMS like LearnDash.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some groups have extensive resources that they want to keep gated, but don’t require any quiz functions. These might include private archives or compilations of professional resources. In this case, the organizers are using membership functions, but without the features of an LMS.</p>
<p>However, if you are offering an online course that uses the lesson hierarchy and assessment tools of an LMS, but also want to sell memberships to your course content, then you’ll need something more. Fortunately, LearnDash has the content protection as well as the LMS features you need to create a course.</p>
<h3>How to use LearnDash as a membership plugin.</h3>
<p>We recently announced that <a href="https://www.learndash.com/membership/">LearnDash had expanded its group function</a> such that it now operates as a full-blown membership plugin. This means that, if you want to create a membership course with multiple levels of content access, you can now do that completely within LearnDash. To understand how, let’s discuss a few of the core features of any good membership plugin.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">Content access.</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">To be clear, LearnDash has always offered content protection—otherwise, our users wouldn’t be able to sell access. In controlling access, users have several options:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>An open course doesn’t require membership or registration. It can be useful to have some courses on your site open, as a marketing tool to familiarize potential learners with your course.</li>
<li>A free course requires users to create a user account and register. This is a more valuable marketing tool than an open course, because you can then follow-up with learners about course offers.</li>
<li>This option requires users to create a user account and register, and places all content behind a paywall. Only users who have registered and paid can access closed content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Note: LearnDash includes two other access settings, “Buy Now” and “Recurring.” However, these cannot be used with shopping carts or other membership plugins, although they will still protect content access.</em></p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">User roles.</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">One of the most important features a membership plugin can offer is the ability to control the user permissions of various members. User permissions in LearnDash use WordPress’s existing user management systems, which allow you to manage user roles from their profile and assign them different attributes. Users can be assigned more than one role at a time, which can help you fine-tune their permissions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In LearnDash, two user roles are particularly important:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Group user.</strong> When a learner is enrolled into a group, they become a group user. This means they will have access to other courses within their group or subgroup.</li>
<li><strong>Group leader.</strong> A group leader has management control over their groups, including adding and removing members. An admin can even assign group leaders the ability to create their own courses!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">Group hierarchy.</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Finally, LearnDash’s group function allows users to create hierarchies within their group structures, which can further control who has access to a certain course. If, for instance, you wanted to offer a course with content accessible to all registrants, but then also divide users into distinct cohorts, you would be able to do that by creating a subgroup.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In this arrangement, learners who had been placed into a subgroup would have access to all content in the umbrella group as well as content in their specific subgroup. However, a group manager who had been put in charge of that subgroup would only be able to manage learners within that subgroup, but not in the larger umbrella group unless given permission.</p>
<p>These features cover the most common scenarios that we encounter from our users. That said, LearnDash does not cover every use cases, and there are instances where working with a membership plugin can be a better solution.</p>
<h3>Using LearnDash <em>with</em> a membership plugin.</h3>
<p>Every day, users come to us with new use cases that we could never have predicted, and we can’t design our plugin to meet them all. Fortunately, because we run on WordPress, our users aren’t restricted by this. If they have another membership plugin they choose to use for whatever reason, they can still build it into their site. Here are some of the popular options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wpusermanager.com/">WP User Manager</a>.</strong> This plugin isn’t a full membership plugin, because it doesn’t involve any payment options. However, it does allow you to establish a user directory through which you can control access.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://memberpress.com/">MemberPress</a>.</strong> MemberPress offers lots of access controls as well as coupons, reporting tools, and Zapier integration.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/">Paid Membership Pro</a>.</strong> Restrict content by type, even down to the level of single pages. Offer unlimited membership levels and multi-tiered membership.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://member.wishlistproducts.com/">Wishlist Member</a>.</strong> Wishlish Member offer flexible content protection, including archiving tools to encourage users to maintain their subscriptions, and partial display options to give un-registered users a sneak peak at your content without offering full access.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://restrictcontentpro.com/">Restrict Content Pro</a>.</strong> This plugin provides a lot of integrations along with membership levels, a custom dashboard, and prorated upgrades and downgrades.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership courses give you more control over how you manage your community.</h3>
<p>The great value membership courses bring to educators is that they create structure and continuity for learners. When a learner creates a user account, it gives them a tool for managing their user profiles, checking their account history, and accessing past purchases. It also gives course creators the ability to contact those learners with more courses, expand or restrict their access, and learn about how their learners engage with their course material.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to use LearnDash to manage your learner membership or a 3rd party membership plugin to expand your capabilities, having these capabilities will help you create a robust community for your course that will serve you well for years to come.</p>

<p>So, you’ve created a course on LearnDash. Next you probably want to know how to sell it, right? Your first steps will be to set up the order fulfillment system that will allow you to list courses as products, have a checkout process, and get paid. And for many of our users, the first and most obvious choice is WooCommerce.</p>
<p>As perhaps the most popular e-commerce plugin on WordPress, WooCommerce offers a robust system for monetizing your course content. You can use it to sell subscriptions to your course, customize the checkout process with special offers, and send follow-up emails to customers.</p>
<p>However, you can take things a step further by adding automations to your sales process with Zapier. By selecting triggers and corresponding actions, you can create interlocking workflows that will practically sell courses for you. In fact, once you get your WooCommerce and Zapier accounts set up, the configurations you can set up to sell more courses are practically limitless. Here’s how you get started.</p>
<h3>1. Set up WooCommerce on your LearnDash site.</h3>
<p>First off, you will need to have a valid licenses for LearnDash and an account with WooCommerce (you can have a free account, but some services, like Subscriptions, are paid). For the full setup process, you can read our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/woocommerce/">WooCommerce for LearnDash integration docs</a>. In the meantime, here are the basics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/woocommerce/">WooCommerce for LearnDash</a> add-on from you WordPress admin area, just as you would any other WordPress plugin.</li>
<li>In your WooCommerce settings, disable guest checkout options, but keep the option for customers to create an account during checkout.</li>
<li>Create products for your courses in WooCommerce. If you want to offer course bundles, you can do so by choosing multiple courses from the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>In LearnDash, navigate to Course Access Settings, set the Access Mode to “Closed,” and paste the URL for your WooCommerce product in the Button URL field.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are additional steps you can take to further customize your course product offerings and the checkout process, but for now this will allow you to sell your LearnDash courses using WooCommerce.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">2. Link your LearnDash to Zapier.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next step is to connect your LearnDash account to Zapier. You’ll need a Zapier account to do this, but you can use either the free or paid version. Again, we have <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/zapier/">support documentation for our Zapier for LearnDash add-on</a>, which you should review if you have any trouble setting it up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Getting started with Zapier is actually faster than with WooCommerce. You simply need to install the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/zapier-integration/">Zapier for LearnDash add-on</a> just as you did for the WooCommerce plugin in the previous section, and you’re ready to start making Zaps.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">3. Set up your Zapier triggers and actions.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">With both WooCommerce and Zapier now integrated with LearnDash, you can begin creating the automations that will connect the dots in your marketing, sales, and enrollment processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the list of Zapier triggers, choose the appropriate WooCommece action. For instance, if you’re selling a course as a product, you can select “Product,” or if you’re selling it as a subscription, you can select “Subscription.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26616" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-2.46.26-PM.png" alt="WooCommerce Zapier trigger" width="500" height="307"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Next, choose the action you want Zapier to take according to the WooCommerce Trigger. The four available for LearnDash + WooCommerce include “Add to Group,” “Enroll Into Course,” “Remove From Course,” and “Remove From Group.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26617" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-2.47.50-PM.png" alt="LearnDash Zapier action" width="500" height="310"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can create multiple Zaps per action, including Zaps that are triggered by each line item in a WooCommerce order. For instance, if a user wants to purchase multiple courses, they can add each course to their shopping cart, and at checkout, Zapier can enroll them in each one. Or, if you sell a bundle of courses, you can use Zapier to add users to a group that contains the course bundle.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">How can Zapier and WooCommerce help me sell more courses?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Automating WooCommerce with Zapier is one of the most popular integrations among our users. However, there are <a href="https://www.learndash.com/18-apps-that-integrate-with-zapier-and-your-course/">many more apps</a> you can integrate with your course and Zapier to automate other functions of your course—everything from marketing emails to notification reminders to social sharing. Used together, and these apps can help you reach more customers with course content and send your sales through the roof.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A few examples of automations that work well together might include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Trigger: </strong>LearnDash Course Complete.<strong><br />
Action:</strong> Create a WooCommerce coupon and send to the learner to prompt them to sign up for a new course.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> LearnDash Lesson Complete.<br />
<strong>Action:</strong> Send a recommendation for a micro course based on that lesson’s content.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Customer Created.<br />
<strong>Action:</strong> Send an email featuring popular courses and an invitation to join your community forum.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Enrolled Into Course.<br />
<strong>Action:</strong> Send a welcome email that includes links to related courses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Automation can save you time while also improving the course experience for your learners.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">It takes some time and careful planning to set up automations, but once an automation is set up it can save you hours of administrative time while improving the experiences of your learners. At the same time, automating your sales and email marketing with Zapier and WooCommerce means you can sell more courses, which will give you even more resources to work with as you improve your offerings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to automating your sales, you really can’t find a better match than Zapier and WooCommerce.</p>

";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"LearnDash Collaborator";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7118:"<h2>Zapier integrates with LearnDash—and from there, to nearly every other app you want to use.</h2>
<p>When most course creators start building content, it’s because they want to turn their expertise in a particular field into a profitable business model. However, what they don’t sign up for is all the administrative work that goes on behind the scenes to keep it all running. These tasks are often tedious and time consuming, and if a course creator can’t keep up with them all, it can lead to missed communications, lost sales, and poor customer reviews.</p>
<p>Fortunately, automation is here to save the day.</p>
<p>The fastest, simplest way to automate course tasks is through our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/zapier-integration/">Zapier add-on</a>. Zapier is an app that allows users to set up “triggers” (such as a customer filling out a form or a learner completing a course), along with automated actions (such as adding a learner to a mailing list, or assigning them a membership rank).</p>
<p>There’s a lot to explore here, but if you want an idea for how these could be used in your course, here are eighteen apps that integrate with Zapier, and through Zapier to your course website <a href="https://www.learndash.com/zapier/">via LearnDash and WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>You can format your triggers and actions in numerous different ways, but we’ve listed a couple ideas with each integration to give you some inspiration.</p>
<h3>E-Commerce &amp; Payment Processing</h3>
<p>First things first: you want to make money off your course, you have the be able to process payments, right? We offer a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/woocommerce/">WooCommerce integration</a> that, combined with your Zapier integration, makes it easier for users to connect payment and enrollment. However, you can also base payment on transactions with various payment processors, such as Stripe or PayPal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WooCommerce.</strong> Automatically enroll learners in your course after purchase or un-enroll them when they cancel their subscription.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe.</strong> Add new accounts to your contacts.</li>
<li><strong>PayPal.</strong> Add new sales to Google Sheets to track income.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>Membership sites are a huge part of many online courses. If you’re using a membership plugin, you can add nuance to your email marketing automations by triggering them once a learner reaches an enrollment level. You can also automate the membership level itself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wishlist Member.</strong> Assign members a level when they enroll. Send them a marketing prompt when they reach a new level.</li>
<li><strong>MemberPress.</strong> This integration is still in process, but if you have an account you can get early access to see what’s available.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Forms</h3>
<p>Forms are an integral part of any site—and e-learning sites more than most. While Zapier offers several integrations for form plugins, two of the most popular options for WordPress sites are Gravity Forms and Ninja Forms. You can connect Zapier to both of these apps and choose automations based on which form fields a user filled out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gravity Forms.</strong> Create leads in SalesForce with new form submissions. Add a form lead to an event.</li>
<li><strong>Ninja Forms.</strong> Add form responses to GoogleSheets. Update mailing lists in MailChimp based on form response.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social</h3>
<p>Social media automations can help your content marketing efforts while also making it easier for you to keep up with customer service. Use Zaps to share events, blog posts, and positive reviews from customers, all while keeping a closer eye on your engagement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slack.</strong> Remind your team of upcoming webinar events by notifying your Slack channel. Share new Twitter mentions to Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer.</strong> Add new blog posts to your queue. Share new webinar events to your Buffer queue.</li>
<li><strong>Hootsuite.</strong> Send an automated thank you message to new followers on Twitter with a link to your starter course.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook.</strong> Publish blog posts to your Facebook page. Send new posts on your Facebook page to Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram.&nbsp;</strong>Create posts to your blog from content you share on Instagram.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter.</strong> Connect your Twitter account with your other social accounts to automatically share content. Save Twitter mentions to Google Sheets to keep track of customer satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn.</strong> Share your latest webinar events to LinkedIn. Add new connections to SalesForce as contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Webinars are a popular event option for many learners, because it helps them feel like they’re being taught by a person rather than being led through an automated system. However, there are several steps in the process of automating event sign-ups that can make this task easier for you—from automatically enrolling attendees in courses to sending them reminder emails so that they don’t forget to turn up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EventBrite.</strong> Get Slack notifications when a new attendee signs up for your webinars. Add attendees to your mailing lists.</li>
<li><strong>GoToWebinar.</strong> Add Gravity Forms registrants to your webinar event. Add new registrants to a MailChip mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Email Marketing</h3>
<p>Finally, while many email platforms include their own automations for scheduling emails, you can make these tools go even further if you link them to other automations—especially ones that have to do with learners in your course.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MailChimp.</strong> Add contacts from a sign-up form to your MailChimp mailing list. Send a welcome email to new registrants. Dripfeed marketing emails to learners who complete a course.</li>
<li><strong>Active Campaign.</strong> Add EventBrite webinar attendees to your mailing list. Add ad leads to your contact list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don’t see an app listed here? Search for it on Zapier!</h3>
<p>The apps we’ve listed here represent some of the most popular tools in the industry, but they’re not all that Zapier has to offer. Their site currently boasts over 2,000 app integrations, and that number is only growing. So if you have other apps that you prefer to use other than the ones mentioned here, there’s a good chance you can find an integration.</p>
<p>And, because Zapier integrates with WordPress, you can easily hook many of these apps up to your online course as well. With Zapier Premium, you can even set up multi-step Zaps that will trigger multiple apps for more complex automations. You can’t automate everything, but with careful planning, you can get pretty close.</p>

Here’s how to find the help you need.</h2>
<p>Over the years, we’ve seen LearnDash users create a range of courses, using our plugin in ways we would never have thought of doing ourselves. That users are continually coming up with new course ideas speaks to the importance of having a flexible LMS like LearnDash. However, it also means people are continually coming to us with new challenges that need resolution.</p>
<p>When users have a question, we want them to get the best answer possible. To that end, we’ve created a lot of resources to address user concerns—both the common questions we get every day, and more unusual questions that strike us as interesting.</p>
<p>However, with so many resources available, you may be wondering where to begin. That’s what this post is for.</p>
<h3>Should you send in a support ticket?</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the obvious question: When should you send in a support ticket?</p>
<p>We’re obviously singing our own praises here, but we have a great support team. We have team members from around the world who work hard to help support our users as best we can.</p>
<p>That said, despite our greatest efforts, sending in a support ticket is not always the right option, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If your issue isn’t with the LearnDash software, we can’t help you.</li>
<li>Our support hours are 7AM – 4PM (EDT), Monday through Friday, and our target is to respond to all support tickets within one business day. So, if you send in a ticket on a Friday afternoon, you may not get a response till Monday.</li>
<li>If you don’t have a specific problem to solve but are instead looking for advice or guidance, there’s only so much our support team can do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, we’ve spent a lot of time developing resources on our support website and on our blog to help you out. And, if you have a unique problem, or if you’re still struggling to find the right answers, we have an excellent community of LearnDash users and WordPress professionals over in our LearnDash Tips &amp; Tricks Facebook group that can help you out!</p>
<p>Before you head over there, however, we recommend trying to find your answer in the following areas.</p>
<h3>1. Read our support docs!</h3>

<h3>4. Search our LearnDash Tips &amp; Tricks group for questions!</h3>
<p>If your question hasn’t been covered in any of our resources, we recommend looking at what our other users have to say. Our LearnDash Tips &amp; Tricks group has been running for several years, and has thousands of members from around the world—both LearnDash course creators like yourself who have gone through the same process you’re experiencing, and experienced WordPress professionals.</p>
<p>Before you ask a question, it’s a good idea to search the group to see if someone else has asked something similar. There are two ways to do this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26584 size-large" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-09-17-at-2.02.19-PM-1024x327.png" alt="The LearnDash Tips and Tricks group menu with search bar cirlced" width="1024" height="327" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the search icon in the upper right corner of the navigation menu and type in some keywords (i.e., “hosting,” or “WooCommerce”). You’ll be able to see other posts that discuss that key term, and may find that someone has already asked your question!<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26587 size-large" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-09-17-at-4.32.16-PM-1024x355.png" alt="Facebook search bar showing search for &quot;hosting&quot;" width="1024" height="355" /></li>
<li>Take a look at the popular tags on the right sidebar of the group.<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26583 size-full" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-09-17-at-2.01.53-PM.png" alt="A screen shot of popular topics in the LearnDash Tips and Tricks forum" width="674" height="420" /></li>
</ol>
<p>These list many of the topics that have been covered in our group, and our team tags new questions as we go so that this list stays up to date.</p>
<p><strong>Join the group »</strong> <a href="https://www.learndash.com/facebook/">LearnDash Tips &amp; Tricks</a></p>
<h3>Ready to ask our LearnDash group for help?</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve done your homework, it’s time to post a question to the group. To get the best answer, it helps to give us as much detail as you can so that the group understands exactly what you’re struggling with. Here’s a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let us know where you’ve looked already!</strong> That way you won’t get a lot of answers telling you to go read a blog post that you already read or watch a webinar that you already watched.</li>
<li><strong>Let us know what solutions you’ve already tried.</strong> Knowing what you’ve done and what the results were will help us eliminate wrong solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Be as specific as you can be about your problem.</strong> Vague questions will get vague answers.</li>
<li><strong>Include screen shots!</strong> Show us what you’re seeing so we can understand what’s going on.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Still having problems? Send in a support ticket.</h3>
<p>Of course, there are some times when sending in a support ticket is the step you need to take after all. You can open a ticket at <a href="https://support.learndash.com/contact-support?fbclid=IwAR3wl99WRIxgbIgD_GeHuzbFCG-ES1p38_CtVlmOcDCIk8g4LVF9T9Az9QI">https://support.learndash.com/contact-support</a>, and one of our team will be available to help with your problem as soon as we are able. Just as in asking questions of the group, the more details you can give us (including screen shots!) the better.</p>
<p>Best of luck, and happy course creating!</p>

<h2>H5P helps instructors create interactive content for free.</h2>
<p>One of the hardest things to do in any online course is to keep learners engaged with the content.</p>
<p>If you have too many videos, it gets boring. No videos at all and it&#8217;s even worse. Images can take you only so far.</p>
<p>And while quizzes are a great way to check-in with learners, they can also become tedious if they&#8217;re used too much.</p>
<p>It is because of this that people often turn to programs like Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate, and&nbsp;iSpring for creating interactive course content.</p>
<p>The problem however is that these programs come with a hefty price tag, so they aren&#8217;t accessible for every budget (with perhaps <a href="http://www.learndash.com/have-you-checked-out-ispring/">exception of iSpring</a>).</p>
<p>That is the bad news.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can create interactive content with another (free) program: <a href="http://www.h5p.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">H5p</a>.</p>
<h3>What is H5P?</h3>
<p>In a sentence: H5P makes it possible for you to create and use interactive HTML5 content.</p>
<p>This content engages learners by turning passive learning (watching videos, reading articles) into active learning (clicking on images, re-arranging pictures, answering flash cards). These simple prompts keep learners from zoning out during a lesson so that they retain more information.</p>
<p><strong>H5P includes features like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flashcards</li>
<li>Charts</li>
<li>Presentations</li>
<li>Memory games</li>
<li>Image hotspots</li>
<li>Interactive video</li>
<li>Timelines</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these features is also a great value-add for your course by giving your lessons a professional polish. However, the best part of this plug-in by far is that it allows for some great use-cases that can elevate a course above the competition.</p>
<h3>What are some use cases for H5P in online courses?</h3>
<p>To get an idea for how H5P can be used in action, let&#8217;s take a look at some use-cases in a course.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Providing instruction details during a video.</strong> Videos can be great, but sometimes the instructions go by too fast, and learners can miss a stop. Interactive videos let you annotate steps so that learners can take notes without having to pause and replay a section of the video multiple times.</li>
<li><strong>Check to see if learners are following along during a presentation.</strong> Include quizzes as slides within a presentation so learners can fill in the blank or select multiple choice answers for material they just read.</li>
<li><strong>Create life-like branching scenarios for training.</strong> <a href="http://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-branching-scenarios-in-e-learning/">Branching scenarios</a> can show learners how a situation might unfold in real time. They unfold like a choose-your-own-adventure, so that learners can apply their training and see what affect their decisions might have on a situation.</li>
<li><strong>Juxtapose images to help learners compare and contrast.</strong> H5P&#8217;s juxtaposition feature lets creators layer two images on top of each other and selectively reveal one side or the other using a sliding bar. This would be a great way to show a before and after image, or to give an &#8220;x-ray&#8221; view of an object.</li>
<li><strong>Click-to-identify an object in an image.</strong> Want to help your learners identify tools for a project, or how to spot early warning signs of an illness? Use a heat map on an image and have learners click on the spot they&#8217;re supposed to find.</li>
<li><strong>Create a personality quiz for team building.</strong> Personality quizzes are popular for a lot of reasons, but they can also be a helpful way for teams to find out more about each other or to help employees or classmates find a group that they&#8217;ll feel comfortable with.</li>
</ol>
<p>H5P has over forty interaction types, each with several examples of the feature in action. <a href="https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications">Take a look for yourself</a> to see how you could put these interactive tools to work in your course.</p>
<h3>How can you install H5P on your course website?</h3>
<p>First you will need to create an account at H5P (don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s free).</p>
<p>Next, install the H5p WordPress plugin on your site and configure the necessary settings. This plugin allows you to import your H5P interactions into WordPress. For the complete step-by-step details and tutorials, <a href="https://h5p.org/documentation/setup/wordpress" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see this article from the H5P documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Once you are done with this configuration you can now insert dynamic interactions within your LearnDash course content.</p>
<h3>Record The Results</h3>
<p>Inserting the dynamic content is one thing. Sure it&#8217;s great for the learner but you want to capture the important data. To do so, you must make sure H5P can transfer learning data to your LMS.</p>
<p>To do this you have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learndash.com/work/grassblade-lrs/">GrassBlade LRS</a>&nbsp;by NextSoftwareSolutions</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uncannyowl.com/downloads/tin-canny-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tin Canny Reporting</a>&nbsp;by UnCannyOwl</li>
<li><a href="https://learning-templates.com/product/learndash-xapi/">xAPI for LearnDash</a> by Learning Templates</li>
</ul>
<p>These will record and report on all of the H5P modules included in your LearnDash courses. Your learners win because they have more interactive (engaging!) course content and you win because you get valuable insight into how your learners are performing.</p>

Is it LearnDash, or something else?</h2>
<p>We not infrequently have customers contact our support team asking for help because something with their website isn’t working. For many, the assumption is that, because LearnDash is the main plugin on their site, if something’s broken, it must be the cause.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in many cases, the issue isn’t with us. This puts us in an awkward position. On the one hand, while we never like finding out that our plugin is causing some issues, we also want to help when we can. At the same time, we simply can’t resolve a lot of problems if they don’t have anything to do with us.</p>
<p>This can be very frustrating for some people. No one likes getting the run-around, and contacting someone for support only to be told “sorry, not our problem” can leave some people feeling like there’s no one out there to help them. So, in situations like this, we usually have two pieces of advice for customers. First, they can find an experienced developer to help them resolve their problem, or second, they can run a conflict test to pinpoint the issue.</p>
<p>A conflict test is a diagnostic procedure that homes in on whatever is causing issues with your site. By stripping your site back to the basics and then gradually layering your themes and plugins back on, you can use the process of elimination to spot where things go wrong. Here’s now it works.</p>
<h3>1. Backup your site before you do any testing.</h3>
<p>First and foremost, make a backup of your site before you do anything. Since you’re going to be doing some serious tinkering with the functionality of your site, you want to be sure that nothing you do causes permanent loss of data or content.</p>
<p>There are several WordPress plugins that you can use to do this, such as <a href="https://ithemes.com/backupbuddy/">BackupBuddy</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack</a>, and in fact, you should be using them regularly to backup your site in case of an emergency.</p>
<h3>2. Temporarily revert to the default theme.</h3>
<p>Next, revert your site back to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/">Twenty Twenty</a> theme. This is the default theme for WordPress, meaning it’s nicely stripped-down, without some of the added functions and widgets that might be causing you problems. This is a solid baseline from which to begin your conflict test.</p>
<h4>Bonus tip: If you don’t want to test a live site, set up an exact replica on a dev or staging site.</h4>
<p>We mostly hear this complaint from new customers who are just starting out with LearnDash and have installed a lot of things all at once. Customers who have been with us for a while don’t usually assume something is wrong with LearnDash the minute something stops working on their site.</p>
<p>However, it does sometimes happen that a long-time customer spots an error and has reason to believe that LearnDash isn’t working. They may have already launched their site, and are wary of conducting this test while their site is live.</p>
<p>In this case, we recommend creating an exact replica of your current site in a safe testing environment. If you have a staging site you can use that, or you can have your host clone your existing site and set it up at a subdomain, such as dev.yourdomain.com. This way you can test to your heart’s content without worrying that you will negatively impact your site.</p>
<h3>3. Deactivate all your plugins except LearnDash.</h3>
<p>With your website set back to the default, it’s time to start deactivating plugins. Since you don’t know which is causing the problem, you want to turn them all off except for LearnDash. Hopefully, when you reach this point, whatever problem you were noticing has gone away. If so, you will have ruled-out LearnDash as the source of the issue.</p>
<p>However, this still doesn’t tell you what the underlying problem is. If you want to figure that out, you have to start turning things on again.</p>
<h3>4. Reactivate each plugin one at a time until you find the culprit.</h3>
<p>With your website essentially “reset,” start activating your plugins again one at a time, testing with each step to see where the issue begins. It’s likely that the issue has to do with how one of the plugins is interacting with the rest of your site. You want to isolate the problem plugin, because that will help you figure out how to move forward. (In some cases the issue could also have to do with your theme.)</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified which plugin is causing problems, you have a couple options. First, you could contact their support team and see if they can help you resolve the issue. Second, you can uninstall that plugin and find a different, more reliable plugin that accomplishes the same thing. And finally, you can contact a professional to work with you one-on-one to find a custom solution.</p>
<h3>If you’re running a default theme, all plugins except LearnDash are turned off, and the issue persists, let us know.</h3>
<p>It sometimes happens that a customer resets to the default theme with only LearnDash running and the problem they were experiencing earlier is still there. If you find yourself in this position, it’s time to contact us.</p>
<p>We recommend our customers do these steps any time they reach out with an error coming from an unknown source. If the problem lies with our program, we want to know! While it might seem like a lot of steps, running a conflict test is a reliable diagnostic method that can help us get to the root of the issue—and solve your problem faster that we would otherwise be able to do.</p>
